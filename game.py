"""
ChineseChecker is a class that represents the game logic for Chinese Checkers.

Attributes:
    size (int): The size of the board.
    piece_rows (int): The number of rows occupied by pieces at the start.
    board (Board): The game board.

Methods:
    __init__(self, size, piece_rows):
        Initializes the ChineseChecker with a board of given size and piece rows.

    startState(self):
        Resets the board and returns the initial state.

    isEnd(self, state, iter):
        Checks if the game has ended given the current state and iteration.

    actions(self, state):
        Returns a list of possible actions for the current player in the given state.

    opp_actions(self, state):
        Returns a list of possible actions for the opponent in the given state.

    player(self, state):
        Returns the current player from the state.

    succ(self, state, action):
        Returns the successor state after applying the given action for the current player.

    opp_succ(self, state, action, last_action):
        Returns the successor state after applying the given action for the opponent.
